# Working With Agent Girl on Design ðŸŽ¨

A comprehensive guide on how to brief, collaborate, and iterate on design with an AI coding agent.

## What I'm GOOD At

### Component Architecture & Systems

- Building **scalable design systems** (colors, typography, spacing)
- Creating **responsive layouts** that work mobile â†’ desktop
- **Organizing UI logically** (semantic hierarchy, information architecture)
- **Performance-conscious design** (lazy loading, optimize images)

### Technical Design Execution

- **Color theory** - complementary palettes, contrast, accessibility
- **Typography** - hierarchy, sizing, letter spacing, weight
- **Spacing & rhythm** - padding, margins, whitespace, breathing room
- **Animations & transitions** - smooth, purposeful micro-interactions
- **Accessibility** - semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation

### Templates & Patterns

- Creating common UI patterns quickly (forms, cards, buttons, modals)
- Building **component libraries** from scratch
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Dark/light mode** systems

### Layout Sophistication

- Grid & flexbox layouts
- Complex multi-column designs
- **Asymmetric layouts** that still feel balanced
- CSS **gradient tricks** and overlays

## What I SUCK At

### Original Creative Direction

I need **reference examples**. I can't tell if your color scheme is "luxury Caribbean" vs "trendy startup" without visual context. I'm pattern-matching, not creating from pure imagination.

### Brand Psychology

I can't inherently know what makes YOUR brand unique. I won't understand the emotional story behind your business without you telling me. I made Amuse-Bouche black/gold/teal, but maybe it should be all white and driftwood? Only you know.

### Photorealistic/Complex Visuals

- Can't generate images (you need Unsplash/photographer)
- Can't create intricate patterns or textures
- Can't do detailed illustrations or custom graphics
- Can't code complex CSS art

### Understanding Context Without Asking

If you say "add island vibes," I might go one direction, but I won't know if you meant:

- Tropical colors (bright)
- Subtle island (what I did)
- Resort luxury (different vibe)
- Caribbean culture (totally different)

### Design Critique

I can't tell you if something is "beautiful" in an absolute senseâ€”only if it follows design principles. Your grandmother might hate minimalism, but it's still good design.

### User Research & Psychology

I don't know your actual users. I can't test if they click buttons or how they feel. You need analytics + user testing for that.

## The BEST Way to Work With Me on Design

### 1. Show Me References

```
GOOD: "I want something like [X brand website] but with [Y twist]"
BAD: "Make it look luxury"

GOOD: "I like the color palette from [screenshot], but make it more playful"
BAD: "I want it to be fun"
```

### 2. Be Specific About Feelings/Context

```
GOOD: "This is for wealthy Bahamas tourism, so clients are expecting
       sophistication mixed with island relaxation"
BAD: "Make it nice"

GOOD: "We're targeting Gen Z, so we want modern, bold, maybe some humor"
BAD: "Make it trendy"
```

### 3. Give Me Design Constraints

```
GOOD: "Use only 2-3 colors max, no patterns, minimal text"
BAD: "Make it pretty"

GOOD: "Mobile-first, must work on slow 3G connections"
BAD: "Make it fast"
```

### 4. Ask For Specific Things

```
GOOD: "Add a way to scroll between testimonials. Make the buttons
       obvious. Should feel premium but casual."
BAD: "Make it interactive"

GOOD: "I want a card component with: shadow, rounded corners,
       hover effect that scales 1.05x"
BAD: "Add cards"
```

### 5. Iterate in Rounds

```
GOOD: "I like the direction, but can you make the gold warmer?
       And I don't like the serif font, try sans-serif"
BAD: "This isn't what I wanted, redesign it"
```

## What I CAN Help You Design

- âœ… **Landing pages, homepages** (like Amuse-Bouche)
- âœ… **UI component libraries** (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
- âœ… **Dashboard layouts** (data visualization, admin panels)
- âœ… **Mobile apps** (screens, flows, responsive)
- âœ… **Color systems** (palettes, gradients, themes)
- âœ… **Typography systems** (font pairings, sizing scales)
- âœ… **Animation & interaction design** (hover states, transitions)
- âœ… **Responsive design** (works on all screen sizes)
- âœ… **Accessibility improvements** (contrast, semantic HTML)
- âœ… **Design refinement** (polish, spacing, alignment)

## The Power Move: Work With a Designer + Me

**Best workflow:**

1. **Designer** creates the vision/concept (mood boards, color palette)
2. **You** give me the design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
3. **I** build it beautifully as code
4. **Designer** reviews, asks for tweaks
5. **I** iterate

This way you get creative direction + clean code.

## How to Brief Me (Copy-Paste Template)

```
Project: [Name]
Vibe: [Luxury/playful/corporate/edgy/minimal/bold]
Audience: [Who is this for?]
Colors: [Show me examples or give me a palette]
Inspiration: [Links to websites/brands you like]
Must-haves:
  - [Specific feature/component]
  - [Specific requirement]
Constraints:
  - [Mobile/desktop/both]
  - [Any technical limits]
Feeling: [One sentence: what should someone feel when they see this?]
```

## Design Iteration Checklist

When asking for changes, be specific:

- [ ] **Colors** - "Make the primary color [#HEX] instead"
- [ ] **Typography** - "Use [Font] for headings, [Font] for body"
- [ ] **Spacing** - "Increase padding from 16px to 24px"
- [ ] **Components** - "Add hover effect that changes color to [Color]"
- [ ] **Layout** - "Stack this 2-column grid into 1 column on mobile"
- [ ] **Animations** - "Fade in instead of slide in" or "Remove the animation"
- [ ] **Accessibility** - "Improve contrast" or "Add alt text to images"
- [ ] **Content** - "Change button text from X to Y"
- [ ] **Responsiveness** - "This section looks broken on iPhone, fix it"

## Common Design Requests I Love

1. **"Add a feature where users can..."** - I can build workflows
2. **"Make this section feel more [emotion]"** - I can adjust design principles
3. **"I want this to look like [brand]"** - I can study and replicate style
4. **"Can you make this mobile-friendly?"** - I can make it responsive
5. **"Add these specific interactions..."** - I can code animations
6. **"Extract a component library from this design"** - I can organize code
7. **"Create a dark mode"** - I can build theme systems
8. **"Make this faster/more accessible"** - I can optimize

---

## What I Need From You

1. **Clear vision** - Show me examples, describe the feeling
2. **Specific requirements** - List what must work
3. **Constraints** - Tell me the limits (tech, audience, platform)
4. **Feedback** - Be exact: "The button is too big" not "It doesn't feel right"
5. **Patience** - Design iteration takes rounds, not one shot

---

## Red Flags (Things That Won't Work)

ðŸš« "Just make it look better" - Too vague
ðŸš« "I'll know it when I see it" - Can't iterate blind
ðŸš« "Make it like that viral design from TikTok" - No context
ðŸš« "Add a feature I'm thinking of but haven't described" - Mind reading required
ðŸš« "Keep everything, but make it completely different" - Contradictory

---

## The Bottom Line

I'm your **code architect & refinement engine**, not your creative director. I can make your ideas absolutely _beautiful_ in code, but you need to bring the vision.

Show me examples â†’ Be specific â†’ I'll build it â†’ You iterate â†’ Repeat until perfect.

**Result:** Beautiful, responsive, accessible, production-ready design in code. ðŸ–¤âœ¨

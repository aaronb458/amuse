## üé® Color Customization

While you're customizing images, you might also want to adjust the accent color.

**Current Gold Color:**

```css
--gold: oklch(0.75 0.2 70);
```

**File:** `src/app/globals.css`

**To Change:**

1. Open `src/app/globals.css`
2. Find the `:root` section
3. Modify the `--gold` variable
4. Use OKLCH format: `oklch(lightness saturation hue)`

**Example: Warmer Gold**

```css
--gold: oklch(0.78 0.25 60); /* More saturated, warmer */
```

**Example: Silver**

```css
--gold: oklch(0.85 0.05 260); /* Cool, subtle accent */
```

## ‚úÖ Verification After Replacement

After updating images:

1. **Run dev server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify images display correctly

2. **Check responsiveness**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Resize to mobile (320px)
   - Resize to tablet (768px)
   - Check desktop (1024px+)

3. **Verify image quality**
   - Images should be sharp and clear
   - Loading should be fast (< 2 seconds)
   - No distortion or stretching

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   Verify no build errors

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. **Use CDN URLs** if available (faster than local)
2. **Ensure image URLs are HTTPS** (required for production)
3. **Optimize for mobile** (Next.js does this automatically)
4. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** (Lighthouse scores)

**Remember:** Quality images are crucial for luxury brands. Invest in professional photography or use high-quality stock images for best results. ‚ú®
